%% VMATE Master Script

% This is fed by two text files, 'default_modem.txt' and
% 'default_propagation.txt' which are not under source control and may be
% freely edited. These files will be made automatically if they don't exist

% This script is partially hard coded. To expand VMATE into a modular
% simulator (i.e. be able change propagation model/modem on the fly),
% follow the suggestions commented below

% I would also recommend editing modem_rx to handle input matrices.
% Currently the workspace only supports one receiver modem's output.
% Supporting matrix input and output would eliminate the need for the for
% loop and provide more debugging information

%% Setup

% Input Parameters
% These should be read in through text files, for now hardcoded because 
% they won't change for the purpose of our project

%% Run VMATE
% This needs to be rewritten to accomodate multiple models. Probably need
% to switch/case the function calls, maybe in other scripts, based 
% on an input text file

% Transmit modem
